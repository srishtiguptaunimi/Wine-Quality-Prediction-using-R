# Predicting wine quality: Supervised Learning 

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on predicting the quality of wine based on various physicochemical properties. Utilizing the R programming language, this project aims to implement machine learning techniques for classification and regression tasks to assess wine quality.

## Contents
- **Data**: The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes various attributes related to wine samples.
- **Scripts**: R scripts for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- **Results**: Visualizations and performance metrics of the models used.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of the methodologies employed and insights derived from the analysis.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships between variables.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for predicting wine quality.
- **Evaluation**: Assessment of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Requirements
To run the scripts in this repository, ensure you have the following packages installed in R:
- `tidyverse`
- `caret`
- `ggplot2`
- `randomForest`
- `e1071`

You can install these packages using the following command:
```R
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "ggplot2", "randomForest", "e1071"))
```

## Getting Started
